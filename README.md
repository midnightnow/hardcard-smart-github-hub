# 🚀 HardCard Smart GitHub Hub

**Never lose data to GitHub timeouts again!**

A free, intelligent upload manager that solves the #1 problem developers face when uploading large repositories or desktop backups to GitHub - timeouts and failed transfers.

## 🌟 Why HardCard Hub?

Every developer has experienced it:
- 📦 Uploading a large project... **TIMEOUT** at 95%
- 🔄 Starting over from scratch... again and again
- ⏰ Hours wasted on failed uploads
- 😤 Frustration with GitHub's upload limits

**HardCard Hub solves all of this with:**
- ✅ **Smart Chunking**: Automatically splits files into optimal chunks
- ✅ **Auto Resume**: Never start over - picks up exactly where it left off
- ✅ **Network Aware**: Adapts to your connection speed in real-time
- ✅ **Rate Limit Handler**: Gracefully handles GitHub API limits
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Know exactly what's happening every second

## 🎯 Features

### Intelligent Chunking System
- Analyzes your network speed and adjusts chunk sizes
- Splits large files to prevent timeouts
- Compresses text files while preserving binaries
- Parallel uploads with automatic throttling

### Bulletproof Reliability
- **Session persistence**: Resume uploads even after system restarts
- **Checksum verification**: Ensures data integrity
- **Automatic retries**: Handles transient failures gracefully
- **Rate limit awareness**: Pauses and resumes based on API limits

### Repository Optimization
- Analyzes repository structure before upload
- Suggests optimizations (git gc, file exclusions)
- Smart compression for faster transfers
- Filters out unnecessary files (.pyc, node_modules, etc.)

## 📊 Performance

| Traditional Upload | HardCard Hub | Improvement |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Fails on 100MB+ files | Handles any size | ∞ |
| No resume capability | Full session recovery | 100% |
| Fixed transfer speed | Adaptive optimization | 3-5x faster |
| Manual retry needed | Automatic recovery | 0 manual work |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install hardcard-github-hub
```

Or clone and run directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hardcard-ai/smart-github-hub
cd hardcard-github-hub
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Upload a repository:**
```bash
hardcard-hub upload --source /path/to/repo --repo my-github-repo --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

2. **Resume an interrupted upload:**
```bash
hardcard-hub resume --session abc123def456
```

3. **Check upload status:**
```bash
hardcard-hub status --session abc123def456
```

4. **Backup your desktop:**
```bash
hardcard-hub backup --source ~/Desktop --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Python API

```python
from smart_upload_manager import SmartUploadManager

# Initialize manager
manager = SmartUploadManager(github_token="YOUR_TOKEN")

# Create upload session
session = manager.create_upload_session(
    source_path="/path/to/large/project",
    repo_name="username/repo"
)

# Start upload with automatic chunking and resume
await manager.parallel_upload(session)

# Check status
status = manager.get_session_status(session.session_id)
print(f"Progress: {status['progress_percentage']}%")
```

## 🎨 Web Dashboard

Open `web-dashboard.html` in your browser for a beautiful real-time monitoring interface:

- Live upload progress tracking
- Network speed visualization
- Session management
- Upload history and statistics

## 🔧 Configuration

### Network Speed Profiles

The system automatically detects your network speed but you can override:

```python
manager.network_speed = 'ultra'  # For fiber connections
# Options: 'slow', 'medium', 'fast', 'ultra'
```

### Chunk Sizes

Default chunk sizes (auto-selected based on network):
- **Slow**: 1MB chunks (dial-up, mobile)
- **Medium**: 5MB chunks (DSL, cable)
- **Fast**: 10MB chunks (fiber)
- **Ultra**: 25MB chunks (datacenter)

### Exclusion Patterns

Customize what gets uploaded:

```python
exclude_patterns = [
    '*.log',
    'temp/*',
    'cache/*',
    '.env'
]
```

## 🛡️ Security

- GitHub tokens are never stored on disk
- All transfers use HTTPS
- Checksum verification on every chunk
- Private repository support by default

## 📈 Use Cases

### 1. Large Project Uploads
Perfect for:
- Machine learning models and datasets
- Unity/Unreal game projects
- Video editing projects
- Full-stack applications with assets

### 2. Desktop Backups
- Automated daily backups
- Selective folder syncing
- Version history preservation

### 3. CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Smart Upload to GitHub
  run: |
    pip install hardcard-github-hub
    hardcard-hub upload --source ./build --repo ${{ github.repository }}
```

### 4. Migration Tool
